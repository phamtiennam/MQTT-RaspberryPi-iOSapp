# MQTT-RaspberryPi-iOS12
I'm too lazy to turn off the bedroom lights when I go to bed.
I want to use my Iphone to control them with my voice.

How I'm going to do it.
1. The bedroom lights are connected with a Raspberry Pi(RPI)
2. The MQTT client is installed in RPI
3. MQTT server is on the cloud or in RPI
4. An IOS 12 app with Siri API and MQTT connection.
