# MQTT-RaspberryPi-iOSapp
I'm too lazy to turn off the bedroom lights when I go to bed.
I want to use the phone to control them with my voice.

How I'm going to do it.
1. The bedroom lights are connected with a Raspberry Pi
2. The MQTT client is installed in RPI
3. MQTT server is on the cloud.
4. An IOS app with Siri API and MQTT connection.
